# Enigma

**Functionality**

3 - Despite some challenges, I finally got my runner files to work. In addition, my Enigma class' encrypt/decrypt methods work.


**OOP**

3.15 - I believe my project was broken down into logical parts and each component has a single responsibility. I have two methods over 7 lines long (excluding ends), but I didn't have time to refactor and shorten those. I believe my variables and methods are named pretty well, and they communicate their purpose.


**TDD**

2.9 - My coverage is at 98% because of two lines of code I would need to stub in to test (I think; also it's the same functionality, so it's really just one line that I'd need to figure out the stub for and then copy it over with minor adjustments), but again, didn't have time to do that. Otherwise, everything else is tested.


**Version Control**

3.25 - I think I did a good job with commits having single functionalities, and I've done multiple pull requests and commits. I also have done (just over) 15 pull requests which I believe have been named decently.
